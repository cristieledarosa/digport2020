# GitHub practice!
**Hello girls, the idea is to practice git, GitHub and algoritms. So here it goes a few instructions:**

**1 -** Clone this repository

**2 -** Create a branch with the name *student/* **YourNameInCammelCase** (don't know what cammel case is? just Google it! :) )

**3 -** In your branch, I want you to create a file/project in **Java OR JavaScript** to solve the problem **COUNT THE A'S**

**4 -** After you finish, please create a **Pull Request** to merge your changes into the Master branch. You can put me as the reviewer.

#### **COUNT THE A'S**

Consider that you have a string, **s**, containing lowercase English letters.

Given this integer, **n**, find and print the number of letter **a**'s in the first **n** letters of the string **s**.

For example, if the string ***s = acacaba*** and ***n = 3***, the substring we consider is ***aca***, the first  characters of her infinite string. There are ***2*** occurrences of **a** in the substring.

**Function Description**

Create a function called *countAString()*. It should return an integer representing the number of occurrences of **a** in the prefix of length in the string.

*countAString* has the following parameter(s):

**s:** a string
**n:** the number of characters to consider

**Input Format**

The first line contains a single string, **s**.
The second line contains an integer, **n**.

**Output Format**

Print a single integer denoting the number of letter a's in the first  letters of the string **s**.

*Note: try to committ each change separately, always putting a description in it.*
